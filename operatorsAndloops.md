# ***Operators and Loops***


Operators are really powerful tools to utilize while coding. They can assign a value. They can do certain things with data such as addition and subtraction, and they use symbols such as %, -, /, ++, -, +, = and * to do so.

See example below:

- For a left shift assignment do the following: x <<= y
- For right do: x >>= y

## **Loops**

Loops let a coder loop something over and over until a condition is met. A for loop is used when you have an idea in mind of how many times that loop should be run. A while loop can be is for instance you want it to run until a specified condition is met. They both have their place and it just depends on
what it is that you're trying to accomplish.
