It was very interesting learning about all the special changes 
one needs to make to their computer to accommodate coding. I had
no idea! There were some stumbles along the way in configuring everything but this entire learning journey has had it's fair share of stumbles and the point is to stay in the game and never give up!

# What is a IDE? What is a text editor?

An IDE is very specific text editor that combines a terminal,
code editor, terminal and database together. It can save time
because allows you to stay in one program and not switch back
and fourth.

A simple text editor like Notepad does nothing other than render 
the plain text. Simple but not feature rich.

A code editor like Visual Studio Code was designed with the coder
in mind and includes a wonderful feature called syntax highlighting
that helps you identify things more clearly.
