***My Summary:***

This is the repository I use to store my work from code-1-3n56.
I hope you like it. I took the code 101 class a few weeks ago and had a great time. 
Wonderful teachers and students here. Great content. Excited to be here again for 102. 
Right now just working in IT and planning my transition to a dev role. I'm on a Windows 10 computer 64bit  
Good luck on your journey :)
