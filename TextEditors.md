# What is an IDE? What is a text editor?

An IDE is very specific text editor that combines a terminal,
code editor, terminal and database together. It can save time
becuase allows you to stay in one program and not switch back
and fourth.

A simple text editor like Notepad does nothing other than render 
the plain text. Simple but not feature rich.

A text editor like Visual Studio Code was designed with the coder
in mind and includes a wonderful feature called syntax highlighting
that helps you idetify things more clearly.
