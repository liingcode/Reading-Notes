 ***Explaining Growth Mindset***

> Having a growth mindset is the ability to grow despite the adversity and set backs one experiences in the learning process. It is to be focused on a mission and to do whatever it takes to accomplish it. Learning and growing oneself presents many unique and sometimes unforeseen challenges, having a growth mindset insures that you not only learn what you set out to do, but also push yourself to succeed at things previously thought as unattainable or far off.
