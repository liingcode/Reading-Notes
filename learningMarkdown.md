# ***A Summary of What Markdown Is***

One of the great things about mardown language is that it's simple.
Simple to learn and write, one can learn the basics in an afternoon
like we did in class. It's a plain text that does not use tags making
it easy to read and write, and most of all....LEARN! 

It's also got some built in formatting options that I find very useful,
like bolding, italicized text, bullet points, and numbered lists. I will show some of these below. Markdown is also a a language hiring managers like to see I found out, and something that not all developers know git stahow to do. This makes it a great syntax to learn and then add to your quiver of tools as a developer!
